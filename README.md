## Project
This repository is created to effectively gather information between two Cisco nodes. The aim is to automaticaly gather the loopback address of the neighbor and interface information like the interface description and status of the link. 

## Status 
[ASR9000 & ASR9000v2](https://github.com/Sebhol95/Simplify_NetOps/tree/master/ASR9000_ASR9000v2/Input_CRC_and_dampening) Input/CRC + dampening collection (up-to 17 satellittes)

## Installation and use
Using linux we can create a folder ```mkdir xxxx``` when we know the folders location we can start implementing the scripts. The code/s are buildt upon one main and sidescripts, alle we need to do is the following: 

**1:** go the the folder you created ```cd /home/somefolder/thecreatedfolder```

**2:** go into bashrc and create a alias for you'r excecutable script ```nano .bashrc``` and enter an alias ```alias = main/home/somefolder/thecreatedfolder/scriptname``` you need to create an alias for all the scripts in the folder. 

**3:** then make them excecutable with ```chmod +x filename``` you also need to do this for all the scripts.

**4:** at last we need to use the bashrc from the folder by typing ```. .bashrc```
