2: go into bashrc and create a alias for you'r excecutable script ```nano .bashrc``` and enter an alias ```alias = main/home/somefolder/thecreatedfolder/scriptname``` you need to create an alias for all the scripts in the folder. 
3: then make them excecutable with ```chmod +x filename```
4: at last we need to use the bashrc from the folder by typing ```. .bashrc```
